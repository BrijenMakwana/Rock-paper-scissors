## Technologies and Tools

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Alan AI

## Setup

1. Download or clone the repository

2. Open ```index.html``` file in your browser.

## Approach

- I have created this game entirely with pure HTML and Vanilla Javascript. I have created 3 images for each Rock, Paper and Scissors. After your selection, a random option will be selected against your play. Then the Algorithm I have written will decide the result if you win or lose.
- I have also integrated Alan AI in this project. I have created 3 functions in Alan studio for each options. Whenever user speak a word, Alan AI will detect the word and if it's one of the 3 options, appropriate option will get selected.
